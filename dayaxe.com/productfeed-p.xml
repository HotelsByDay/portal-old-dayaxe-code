Today, the outdoor oasis is styled by celebrity designer Estee Stanley and is the place to “see and be seen.” Guests can enjoy poolside perks such as dining service from CIRCA 55, signature Beverly Hilton pool rafts for rent, and summertime entertainment. Splurge on some red carpet pampering at the Aqua Star BABOR Beauty Spa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A day at the Beverly Hilton, home of the annual Golden Globes and numerous Hollywood galas, is sure to have you feeling like a celebrity. </productdescription>

    <productdescription>This iconic hotel offers the perfect combination of Beverly Hills luxury and Hollywood chic. The Aqua Star Pool is one of the most famous pools in Beverly Hills, a place where history happens. Its sparkling waters have been known to tempt the bravest of Hollywood starlets: film star Esther Williams “christened” the pool at the opening night gala in 1955; 36 years later, actress Angelina Jolie jumped in after winning her second Golden Globe®. Today, the outdoor oasis is styled by celebrity designer Estee Stanley and is the place to “see and be seen.” Guests can enjoy poolside perks such as dining service from CIRCA 55, signature Beverly Hilton pool rafts for rent, and summertime entertainment. Splurge on some red carpet pampering at the Aqua Star BABOR Beauty Spa. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A day at the Beverly Hilton, home of the annual Golden Globes and numerous Hollywood galas, is sure to have you feeling like a celebrity. </productdescription>
